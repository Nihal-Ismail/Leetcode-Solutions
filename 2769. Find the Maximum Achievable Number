2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number Using Python

Hint
Given two integers, num and t. A number is achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation:

Increase or decrease the number by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
Return the maximum achievable number after applying the operation at most t times.

Constraints:
1 <= num, t <= 50

'''Python'''

class Solution:
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int):
        if num >= 1 and t <=50:
            y=num+t
            x=y+t
            return x
