3110. Score of a String Using Python

Hint
You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Return the score of s.

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

```Python

class Solution:
    def scoreOfString(self, s):
        if s.lower() and 2<= len(s) <=100:    
            l=[ord(i) for i in s]
            s=[abs(l[i]-l[i+1])for i in range(len(l)-1)]
            total=sum(s)
            return(total)
